A rotation shifts the elements of the vector in a specific direction. 
A right rotation is equivalent to taking the last element and inserting it into the first position.

Implement the rotation operation. Note that by calculating the final positions correctly, you will perform a single operation to transpose the positions of the vector.

Input
Line 1: Size of the vector T and the number of elements to be rotated R
Line 2: Elements of the vector

Output
Rotated vector
